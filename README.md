# Git & Git hub - The Full Course

A fast-paced course for getting up to speed with git and github

## Basics

### Config

`git config --global user.name "User"`
`git config --global user.email "hello@gmail.com"`

`git config --list`

### Create a repository

`git init`

### Common

View the current status of a repo
`git status`

#### Add

Add an entire working directory to the staging area:
`git add .`

Add a file
`git add somefile.txt`

Remove a file from the staging area:
`git reset .`

#### Commit

Commit staged files to a repository
`git commit -m "initial commit ðŸš€"`

Add files and commit in a single command
`git commit -a -m "additional commit"`
`git commit -am "additional commit"`

view history of commits
`git log`

#### Remote

List current remotes in the local repo:
`git remote`

Create a new remote
`git remote add origin <url-to-your-github-repo>`

#### Push

`git push origin <branch name>`
-u flag is used to set origin as the upstream remote in your git config so git pull can be used without any arguments in the future.

#### Merge

get remote repositories
`git fetch`
merge that repository  
`git merge origin/master`

Combine the fetch & merge from the previous section with the pull command.
`git pull` need to do -u command first or specify remote branch `git pull origin <branch>`

View merge conflicts
`git diff`

Abort Merge
`git merge --abort`

#### clone

`git clone <repo-url> <local-directory>`

##### Forked

In order to get changes from upstream Add the remote
`git remote add upstream <original repo>`

Download the changes;
`git fetch upstream`

Add changes
`git rebase upstream/main `

#### Branch

list of all branches
`git branch`

rename your branch
`git branch -M <new name>`

Create a branch
`git branch <new branch name>`
`git checkout -b <new branch name>`

Delete a branch

`git branch -d <branch name>` Only will delete if it hasn't been merged into an origin
`git branch -D <branch name>` will delete no mater what

Switching branches
`git checkout <branch name>`

Checkout the previous branch you were on
`git checkout -`

### Trouble shooting

Remove a file from the staging area: (one that has been added)
`git reset .`

Go back to a previous commit without deleting previous state
`git reset <commit id>`

Go back to previous commit and delete commits after it
`git reset --hard <commit id>`

Note: never do a reset if you have already pushed if you remove it, it can be hard to reconcile the changes.

If you have a bad commit and have pushed you can Undo a commit with a new commit
`git revert <commit-ID> -m "reverting last commit"`

Change commit message

`git commit --amend -m "better message"`

Include a file you forgot on your last commit. (--no-edit means not changing the message)
`git add <your-file>`
`git commit --amend --no-edit`

Save your work without committing to repo with stash
`git stash list`
`git stash save <name>`
`git stash pop` takes the most recent stash
`git stash apply <index>`

Use git rebase to merge updates with a clean commit history
How to make your code look like your working from the latest commit?
`git rebase main`

If you want to squash your commits
`git rebase main --interactive`

replace <b>pick</b> with <b>squash</b>

show better git log
`git log --graph --oneline --decorate `

How to find which commit broke your code?

As an example, suppose you are trying to find the commit that broke a feature that was known to work in version v2.6.13-rc2 of your project. You start a bisect session as follows:

$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2 # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good
Once you have specified at least one bad and one good commit, git bisect selects a commit in the middle of that range of history, checks it out, and outputs something similar to the following:

Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)
You should now compile the checked-out version and test it. If that version works correctly, type

$ git bisect good
If that version is broken, type

$ git bisect bad
Then git bisect will respond with something like

Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
Keep repeating the process: compile the tree, test it, and depending on whether it is good or bad run git bisect good or git bisect bad to ask for the next commit that needs testing.

Eventually there will be no more revisions left to inspect, and the command will print out a description of the first bad commit. The reference refs/bisect/bad will be left pointing at that commit.

### Hooks

use husky `npm install husky -D` to configure git hooks validate your code before each commit
